# KasaPa

KasaPa is a daily assistive tool designed for Akan-speaking individuals with speech impairments, helping them to be heard in any situation. The app uses cutting-edge ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) models trained on non-standard Akan speech and TTS (Text-to-Speech) technology to empower users to communicate effectively, participate in conversations, and share their voice across platforms.

## ✨ Features

- **Akan Speech Transcription**: Speak to KasaPa and have your words transcribed using ASR models tailored for non-standard Akan speech patterns.
- **Transcription Editing**: Edit the transcribed text for improved accuracy before sharing or playback.
- **Natural Sounding Speech**: The app leverages advanced TTS models to convert text into clear, natural-sounding Akan speech.
- **Voice Note Sharing**: Send voice notes to social media platforms, emails, and more.
- **Classroom & In-Person Support**: Use KasaPa to contribute in classrooms or be understood during face-to-face conversations.
- **Live Presentations with QR Code**: Utilize a unique QR code system to link with the web app for live presentations—real-time transcription and speech delivery included.
